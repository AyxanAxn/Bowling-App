Bowling Game Rules
Overview
A bowling game consists of ten frames, where a player attempts to knock down pins arranged at the end of a bowling lane. The game combines skill, strategy, and scoring rules that reward consistent performance.
Basic Structure
Each game consists of 10 frames
Standard frames allow up to 2 throws per frame
Players aim to knock down all 10 pins
Pins knocked down are removed before subsequent throws within the same frame
The 10th frame may contain up to 3 throws depending on performance
Throws and Frames
Regular Frame: If a player fails to knock down all 10 pins in the first throw, they get a second throw to target the remaining pins
Strike: When a player knocks down all 10 pins with the first throw of a frame, it's called a "strike" and the frame is complete
Spare: When a player knocks down all 10 pins using both throws of a frame, it's called a "spare"
Special Rules for the 10th Frame
If a player rolls a strike in the 10th frame, they receive two additional throws
If a player rolls a spare in the 10th frame, they receive one additional throw
These bonus throws are used solely for scoring purposes and allow the player to earn bonus points
Scoring System
The scoring system in bowling rewards accuracy and consistency:
Open Frame: When a player fails to knock down all 10 pins in a frame, the score for that frame is simply the total number of pins knocked down
Spare: When a player achieves a spare, the score for that frame is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down on the next throw
Strike: When a player achieves a strike, the score for that frame is 10 plus the total pins knocked down on the next two throws
Total Score: The game's total score is the sum of all ten frames
Example
Frame 1: 7 pins, then 2 pins = 9 points (open frame)
Frame 2: 10 pins (strike) = 10 points + bonus from next two throws
Frame 3: 8 pins, then 2 pins (spare) = 10 points + bonus from next throw
Frame 4: 9 pins, then 0 pins = 9 points (open frame)
Scoring Display
Each frame displays:
The pins knocked down in each throw
The running total (cumulative score) after that frame is completed
Perfect Game
A perfect game (12 consecutive strikes) results in a score of 300 points, the maximum possible score in a single game of bowling.
